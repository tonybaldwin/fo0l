# Thou ruttish, hell-hated mammet!

![Shakespeare](http://tonyb.myownsite.me/images/shakespeare.gif)

Here you have three scripts:

* fo0l.py - a Shakespeare insult generator in python (released according to the terms of the GNU GPL v. 3)
* shakes.py - graphical version of above with tkinter gui
* shakes.php - a Shakespeare insult generator in php (released according to the terms of the GNU Affero Public License)


## fo0l.py

This is a simple python script to run from cli to generate a 
random "Shakespearean" insult, like:

**Thou reeky, rampallian knave!**

Just stick it in your path and run it from the command line with
fo0l

Like

:~$ fo0l

**Thou fusty, rampallian maggot-pie!**

### Dependencies:
fo0l.py requires python (duh)
shakes.py requires python and tkinter
shakes.php requires php and a webserver

### Graphical client
I wrote a gui version (with tkinter), available at 
http://wiki.tonybaldwin.info/doku.php?id=hax:shakes
UPDATE: shakes.py (gui w/tkinter) now included in this repo

## Shakes.php

A live, internet version in php is at
http://tonyb.us/shakes

If you have any questions, drop me a line,

**Thou roguish, livered joithead!**
