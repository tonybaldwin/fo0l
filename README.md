# Thou ruttish, hell-hated mammet!

Here you have two scripts:

* fo0l.py - a Shakespeare insult generator in python (released according to the terms of the GNU GPL v. 3)
* shakes.php - a Shakespeare insult generator in php (released according to the terms of the GNU Affero Public License)


## fo0l.py

This is a simple python script to run from cli to generate a 
random "Shakespearean" insult, like:

Thou reeky, rampallian knave!

Just stick it in your path and run it from the command line with
fo0l

Like
:~$ fo0l
Thou reeky, tickle-brained devil-monk!

### Dependencies:
fo0l requires python (duh)

### Graphical client
I wrote a gui version (with tkinter), available at 
http://wiki.tonybaldwin.info/doku.php?id=hax:shakes

## Shakes.php

A live, internet version in php is at
http://tonyb.us/shakes

If you have any questions, drop me a line,
thou roguish, livered joithead!
